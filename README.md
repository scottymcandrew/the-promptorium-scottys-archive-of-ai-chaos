# The Promptorium: Scotty's Archive of AI Chaos

Welcome to my collection of AI prompts ranging from the absurdly hilarious to the genuinely useful. This is where I store the prompts I use for public speaking demos, experimentation, and general AI tomfoolery.

## What's Inside?

A chaotic mix of:
- **Satirical personas** that poke fun at corporate culture and tech industry stereotypes
- **Speaking event demos** designed to entertain and educate audiences
- **Creative experiments** that push AI in weird and wonderful directions
- **Serious, practical prompts** for actual work (yes, really)

Think of this as part comedy sketch archive, part professional toolkit, and part mad scientist's notebook.

## Disclaimer

While many of these prompts are designed for humor and entertainment, **you'll also find legitimate, serious prompts** in here for real-world applications. Not everything is a joke—some of this stuff actually works in production.

Use your judgment. Read the prompt before you run it. Your mileage may vary.

## Organization

Prompts are organized by:
- `personas/` - Character-based AI prompts (mostly satirical)
- `demos/` - Speaking event and presentation material
- `utilities/` - Serious, practical prompts for actual work
- `experiments/` - The weird stuff that may or may not work

Got a wild prompt idea? Found a bug in one of my personas? Feel free to open an issue or PR. Just remember: chaos is a feature, not a bug.

MIT - Use these prompts however you want. If they make you laugh, break your AI, or somehow make you money, let me know!
